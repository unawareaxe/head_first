    <h3>Antonio Brown Throws a Tantrum After Not Getting Thrown to While Wide-Open</h3>

        Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown have developed a strong connection over the years, but in Week 4, the Pittsburgh Steelers' star receiver wasn't thrilled with his quarterback. <br>
        
        On a play in the first half against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, Brown managed to get wide open down the middle of the field. Unfortunately for the wideout, Roethlisberger never saw him and wound up missing his target near the line of scrimmage.  <br>
        
        The play didn't sit well with Brown...at all. He was seen throwing his hands up and then later taking his anger out on a Gatorade cooler on the sideline. Business was not booming—but the Gatorade cooler sure was.  
        Antonio Brown just can’t stay out of trouble. <br>

In his latest incident off the field, the seven-time Pro Bowler and Buccaneers wide receiver in October was accused by his Florida gated community of destroying a security camera and throwing his bicycle at the security gate arm after being asked to come down to the gate so he could escort a guest inside, the Miami Herald reported Monday. <br>

That request did not sit well with Brown, who in the midst of his temper tantrum yelled at the security guard, “Why are you wasting my f—ing time, you need to let my guest through the f—ing gate,” according to police. <br>

But Brown, already under probation for a prior arrest, avoided having criminal mischief charges pressed against him by the luxury development where he owns a $6.6 million mansion, because the president of the Hollywood Oaks homeowners association feared the 32-year-old “may retaliate against her employees,” she told police.

Sylvia Berman, the HOA president, later downplayed the incident in an interview with the newspaper. She said the board thought the incident was too minor to press charges and that Brown, who earlier had been fined for undisclosed rule violations within the community, agreed to replace the broken camera. <br>

Berman then defended what she called Brown’s “emotional” reaction to being called down to the gate and called him a “hero” for having seven receptions and 69 yards during Sunday’s 46-23 win over Carolina. <br>

The case was eventually cleared by Hollywood police on Nov. 5, less than two weeks after Brown signed a one-year contract carrying a $750,000 base salary with Tampa Bay. <br>
